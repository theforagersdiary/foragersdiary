Don't go down the path of trying to fit your fungi find to photographs
This way madness lies
Fungi often vary greatly in appearance, smell, texture etc. for any number of reasons including age, weather conditions, environment etc.
Use a systematic approach - it doesn't have to be complex.
Accept that you won't always get a positive ID. 

There's a reason I've place the fungi headings in the order they are.
It's a good order to make observations in
- Habitat first. Where are they growing? What are they growing on. What species are they near or on?


Young fungi often don't show all the defined characteristics until maturity. Sometimes characteristics can only be observed when young/mature/old etc.

Finding a sample of young and mature is helpful.

If you're wanting to ID - get as much info as possible before lifting the fungi.
Use a knife to get the whole fungi. Much of the ID info can be contained in the base below the surface.
