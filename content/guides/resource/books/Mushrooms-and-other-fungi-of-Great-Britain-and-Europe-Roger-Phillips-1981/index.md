This is one of my favourite fungi reference books. Iâ€™ll leaf through it just for the sake of looking at cool pictures of fungi. There is a new edition available through Collins, but mine is the original published in 1981 that came to me from one of my older relatives when I was a teenager, and but for some updates on naming and other information, I like this one the best. The images are big, clear, and plentiful. The species covered are vast, and the information for each is short and succinct.
