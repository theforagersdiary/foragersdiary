This is one of those recipes I've been making since I was a kid. It's quick, easy, and can be scaled up and stored in a jar or bottle in the fridge for well over a week. This dressing goes well on too many things to list and is easily adapted to foraged ingredients.

## Ingredients
---
- 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon golden syrup
- 1 teaspoon wholegrain mustard

1. Simply combine all the ingredients into a bowl or jar and mix until everything is...well...mixed. The dressing will emulsify and turn a lovely consistency when it's ready.
2. Drizzle away

I've added this here because with this recipe there are some great adaptations that can be made!

## Blackberry Vinaigrette

If you've made some of this blackberry vinegar, then simply add two tablespoons of this in place of the 1 tablespoon golden syrup.

## Wild Garlic Vinaigrette

Add a couple of tablespoons of wizzed up wild garlic leaves to the base recipe for a really tasty garlic kick. I like to add an extra squeeze of lemon too.
