summary: The Amethyst Deceiver is a good edible fungus thats easily identifiable. Don't let the ominous name 'deceive' you. The deception here comes from it's rapidly changing appearance from one day to the next. Whilst usually small, it makes up for this by often growing in large groups. When you find one, more will often be lurking close by.

The Amethyst Deceiver is a great edible fungi thats easily identifiable in it's prime. Don't let the name 'deceive' you. Whilst small, it makes up for this by often growing in large groups. When you find one, more will often be lurking close by.

## Habitat/Season

**Habitat:** Deciduous woodland, Coniferous woodland, Mixed woodland

**Season:** Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov

Preferring to grow under beech and oak, they can however be found almost anywhere else where there is suitable mycorrhizal partners including deciduous and coniferous woodland.  
You will often spot these on mossy patches, mainly due to the contrast in colours, however they are equally often found amongst the leaf litter for the keen eye.

## Cap/Flesh/Fruiting Body

**Average cap size:** 10 - 70mm  
**Cap shape:** Starting convex before flattening out  
**Cap colour:** Purple/Pale Purple

The cap shape varies wildly, and a specimen can change shape/colour overnight.  
The cap starts convex before flattening out. The cap may become upturned, show a central depression, show uneven wavy edges as it matures or a mix of one or all of these! However, it is still an easily identifiable fungi in its prime.  
The cap, gills and stem are purple all over. This colour can vary from deep to very light. It will also vary in shade due to moisture levels.  
As it ages, the colour can drain and become a light tan with almost no sign of the purple colour.

## Gills/Pores/Tubes/Spore

**Gill density:** widely spaced  
**Gill colour:** purple  
**Gill attachment:** adnate, emarginate  
**Spore print:** white  
**Spore shape:** ellipsoidal, smooth

The gills share the same colouring as the cap, however, surprisingly the spore print is white. A great example of not using the gill colour as a definitive indication of spore colour.  
They are widely spaced, irregular, broad and adnate/emarginate. The colour will fade as it ages.

## Stem

The stem is fibrous, sharing the same colour characteristics as the cap. Additionally, the stem will have streaks of paler purple/white/grey due to the fibrous nature.

## Possible Confusions

There are several species that may appear similar at a glance, but even a rudimentary inspection is enough to tell this fungi apart. As it ages and looses it's colouring, this can prove more difficult. 

## Edibility/Taste/Smell

Pleasant mild mushroomy smell and taste. Good texture. Cap only - the stem is too tough for use unless you dry and powder them.

## Notes

**Etymology:** amethystina = reference to the colour of cap

Great for pickling - the pickle colour produced is beautiful.
