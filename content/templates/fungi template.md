## Possible Confusions

Can be confused with a 'funnel' (Clitocybe)
Key features telling it apart from them:
- gills brown - not white
- spore colour brown - funnels are white
Velvet Rollrim - grows on wood, usually on or near conifer stumps. Also considered unsafe.


## Edibility/Taste/Smell

Unsafe to eat. Mild mushroomy smell. Sharp acidic slightly mushroomy taste.

## Medicinal Uses


## Notes

Still eaten in some areas of the world. Prepared by boiling. Water thrown away before final cooking. This is considered the right approach like other species to remove the toxins. The soluble ones are mostly removed. However there are many other complex toxins that are not.

The link to it's poisonous nature was not widely known as the effects are not felt until enough of the toxins have built up. This cumulative effect gives the temporal spacing of any patterns being observed by the eater. 

The body builds a complex allergic reaction, which is revealed as "autoimmune haemolytic anaemia" - your body's antibodies attack your red blood cells, causing severe potentially fatal effects.

Don't eat these.

> A high-profile case of paxillus poisoning occurred in 1944, when the famous German mycologist Julius Schäffer died after eating a meal made from these milkcap lookalikes.[^1]
