**Silky Rosegill** - _Volvariella bombycina_   
**Other names:**  *Agaricus bombycinus*, *Volvaria bombycina*  
**Season:** Summer, Autumn  
**Edibility:** Edible  
**Fungi Type:** Fungi With Gills, Saprobic

**Habitat**: Deciduous woodland, particularly found on elm, beech, maple, oak

**Key Features**:

- Most commonly a solitary find.
- Growing from dead hardwood (often from dead wood in living trees).  
- White silky fibres on cap.
- Membranous volva at the base of the stem.
- Usually growing high in trees. No Amanita fungi in the UK grows high in trees, so this is an excellent ID feature to distinguish it.

The Silky Rosegill is a particularly beautiful fungi to come across. It's most commonly found growing by itself from dead deciduous wood. With careful observation, this fungi is easy to identify and it's a good edible species. However, because of its rarity, this species is best left be.

## Habitat

A saprobic species - found growing on dead hardwood, particularly beech, elm and maple. Often found growing from dead damaged wood on living trees, preferring wood in early stages of decomposition.  This is almost always a solitary find, although occasionally can be seen in small groups of 2-3. 

## Cap/Flesh

The cap and flesh is white to off-white (cream) coloured, browning a little with age. It's covered in fine silky fibres all the way to the cap margin, giving it a 'fluffy' look.
The size and shape of the cap is quite variable between specimens and development stage.
The cap shape starts ovoid, becoming bell-shaped with maturity, usually with an inrolled margin. 
Average cap size: 50 - 200mm  
The cap can sometimes have remnants of the volva attached to the cap.

## Gills/Pores/Tubes/Spore

The gills are white or pink depending on age. They are crowded, free from the stipe and appear to terminate before the margin.


## Stipe/Ring/Volva

Stipe length: 70 - 150mm  
Stipe diameter: 10 - 20mm  
Stipe colour: White  
Stipe ring: No ring  
Stipe texture: Smooth, Fibrous  
Stipe other: tapering from base, often curved  
Stipe base: bulbous    
Volva: persistent, membranous, white, yellowing with age. Most commonly has brown flecks or scales over it.

## Spore Print

Pink to pink/brown. Ellipsoidal. Smooth.

## Possible Confusions

## Taste/Smell

A pleasant mildly mushroomy smell and taste with excellent texture. Dries well.

## Medicinal Uses

## Notes

Volvariella refers to the prominent visible volva at the base of the stipe. Bombycina is derived from the Latin 'bombycis' meaning silky.
