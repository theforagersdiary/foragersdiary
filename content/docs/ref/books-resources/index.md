A good selection of reference books are invaluable to the forager. I'll be adding seperate reviews when I get the time, but for now here is my list if I were to start from scratch.
Usually a mix of feild guides (ones you can put in a bag and easily reference) and reference books (ones that are just too impractical for feild use) are recommended. I have a bit of a loathing for mobile phones, usually keeping mine of silent/airplane mode for most of the time and only really grabbing it to take photographs or sending a quick message to my wife with my eta.
However, if you're only tentetivley dipping your toes into foraging, then the first book on my list, coupled with a few of good foraging sites with excellent images/reference material you can access from your phone is all you need.

## Starting Out

### _The Forager's Calendar - John Wright_ - 9/10
This book was a recent addition that I picked up on a whim this year, and I'm really pleased I did. If there's one book I'd heartily recommend to anyone with even a hint of an interest in foraging, it would be this one. 
While expereinced foragers might not glean much in the way of extra information species wise, John's writing style is witty, engaging and his advice is pragmatic. I've really enjoyed this book, and often refer to it just to read his take on a particular species.
For beginners it covers everything you really need. There is a good balance between plants and fungi, and the species are helpfully listed in month by month sections based on best harvesting times. Reading it, you will be bombarded with his enthusiasm and humour towards the topic which you will find quite infectious. 
There are fairly clear descriptions and a photograph or two of the specie being discussed. This would be my only negative comment on this. It's a great sized paperback to take out and about with you, but the lack of images of the species in various stages let this down as a 'field guide'. It's not a biggie - the image for each species is clear, and there are plenty of other resources to draw from to back up your findings. I hope in future editions the publishers might add even just an extra 1/2 page of supporting photographs/illustrations - this would make it a 10/10 beginners field guide.
Highly recommended. Not only is the information clear, the enthusiasm and confidence it instills in you is invaluable.

The next few books can be had second-hand for a song - I totted it up and for less than a tenner you can get some of the best books out there to get you started!

### _Mushrooms of Britain and Europe (Black's Nature Guides)_ 9/10
Whilst this book is out of print, the canny shopper can still grab this for a couple of quid. I had my copy for over a decade before giving it to a friend to use....we all know how that goes. Last year I picked up another copy for Â£2 from an online second hand bookshop - handily it had come from a library so still had the vinyl covers libraries often use! They do get listed for a lot more, but with a bit of patience one can be found dirt cheap still.
A true feild guide, there is enough information on about 360 species of fungi found in the UK to get you started. Divided into fungi with pores, fungi with gills, and other fungi, each of these is then arranged by spore colour and gill attachment. The latter arrangment is my only niggle. Whilst the divisions of pores/gills/other is colour tabbed for really quick access to those pages, the spore colour/gill attachment section isn't. It's not a real issue as there's a reference on the front and back covers to those pages, but it's something that could have been easily included and made accessing those pages even easier.
Coupled with the book I mention next, this really is all you need to get cracking!

### _Mushrooms and other fungi of Great Britain and Europe - Roger Phillips_ 9/10
This is one of my favourite fungi reference books. I'll leaf through it just for the sake of looking at cool pictures of fungi. There is a new edition avaliable through Collins, but mine is the original published in 1981 that came to me from one of my older relatives when I was a teenager, and but for some updates on naming and other information, I like this one the best. The images are big, clear and plentiful. The species covered are vast, and the information for each is short and succinct.
