## Ingredients

---

- 600g fresh blackberries
- 350ml bottle of red wine
- 200ml vodka/gin
- Heaped tablespoon of dried and crushed up Meadowsweet (optional)
___

## Method

1. Crush blackberries in a saucepan
2. Mix with a good glug of the wine
3. Mix in the sugar and meadowsweet
	
	The combined mix should just be ‘wet’. Doesn’t matter if it’s a bit sloppier - just not dry - otherwise the mix might catch on the pan.

If you want to make it even tastier and have the patience then for steps 1-3 simply crush the berries and combine with the sugar, meadowsweet and ALL the wine and leave in a clean covered container for about 2-3 days. Don't complete seal the container - the natural yeasts in the plant matter can start to ferment and build pressure pretty quickly sometimes.

4. Put pan on a low-med heat and bring to a simmer.
5. Simmer for about 10 mins stirring occasionally.
6. Remove from heat and pour in the rest of the wine. This will get it cooled down quicker.
7. Strain through a sieve and smush the pulp through with a spoon. Get all that sexy juice out.
	
	The pulp left will still be really flavourful - don’t waste it. I’ve let it cool and then added it to currently brewing meads, vinegars etc.

8. Add the spirit, mix and then add the mixture to some sterilised bottles . It’ll fill about two 75cl bottles.

The flavour improves with some time left in the bottles. It can be stored in a cupboard for well over a year but it’s one of those things that gets devoured well before.
