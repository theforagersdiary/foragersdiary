## Why foraging?

Foraging allowed me to find a place in this world. 
For over a decade I was an archaeologist, travelling the country and digging my way through my twenties. I worked on incredible projects and dug at incredible sites. It was an immensely special connection to our past. For me, find 'treasure' wasn't as special as finding a connection. The most exhilirating find I made in my time was of a small sherd of pottery. It wasn't anything special - just a bit of run of the mill prehistoric stuff. The thing that made this peice stick with me was that on its surface was a clear impression of the potters thumbprint. Whorls and ridges were visible. I placed my thumb there and it was as if this one small action has bridged the thousands of years between me and them.
But, field archaeology takes it's toll. It's not glamarous, it's hard on the body and the conditions, especially when working in commercial archaeology, can beging to outweigh the passion. When my hip started playing up, I decided to make a new start.
I tried many things, but it wasn't until I began taking foraging seriously (something I'd always just 'done a spot of') that something I'd lost was found again.
It brought meaning and purpose through offering a real connection to our world. I could be outdoors, and choose when to evade the harsh elements by hunkering down in my study to read or type up some notes.
